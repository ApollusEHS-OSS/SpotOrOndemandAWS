# There might be scenarios where you are booting up Spot instances and OnDemand instances, when working with AWS EC2 instances.
# Difference between Spot & OnDemand instances are - Pricing & reliability 
# Read - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html#spot-features for more details

# The below set of instructions work from inside an instance, i.e., you can figure out whether the machine is Spot or OnDemand 
# - once they are booted. This method doesn't give details of instance type before starting the agent.

# The possible usecase of using this is when you have to switch between Spot & OnDemand instances dynamically inside a build.
# For instance, switch a bigger OnDemand instance, when you have critical part of build that should be assured not to encounter -
# - infrastructure issues


Step 1: Identify the instance ID of the node.
Step 2: Use the instance ID to extract the meta-data of the instance
Step 3: Look for an identifier which confirms whether the node is Spot or an OnDemand instance


Step1 : curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
  This step returns an instance id, let's call it, 'ID'
  169.254.169.254 is a network address that can be used communications within broadcast domain where the host is connected to.

  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ can be used to determined all categories of meta-data.
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id is used to extract only instance-id from all the categories in meta-data
  
 
Step2: aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids ${ID} --region ${AWSRegionWhereInstanceIsHosted}
  This step extracts the instance information for the given ID
  Please note that the region where this instance is hosted should be mentioned explicitly.

Step3: aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids ${ID} --region ${AWSRegionWhereInstanceIsHosted} | findstr "SpotInstanceRequestId"
  Previous step outputs the instance information in JSON format
  So, use 'findstr' or 'grep' or any platform independent command to extract the exact information, if you use multiple platforms
  
Result: The identifier 'SpotInstanceRequestId' is present in instance information, only when it is spot instance.

So, based on the identifier, you can decide whether the agent is Spot or Ondemand instance.
